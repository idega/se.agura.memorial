 * 
 
Here you would create business class of type IWServiceBean  and this 
class should handle looking up the available searches and use the right 
one to search.  When search implementations have been instanceiated the 
would be stored in this businessbean since it is stored in application, 
and then the search implementation will only have to be instanciated 
once.
On page 8 in the spec the database tables are described but I think we 
need one more column in grave_database_conn to store the name of the 
implementing class.
